# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a GRAPH RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system specifically designed to parse Drools rule files (.drl) from the project's drools folder and create a knowledge graph in Neo4j. The system will analyze the structure and relationships between rules, conditions, actions, and referenced objects, storing this information in a Neo4j graph database. This graph will then enable intelligent querying and retrieval of rule-based information through natural language interactions, allowing users to understand complex rule relationships and dependencies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want to query Drools rules using natural language, so that I can quickly understand rule relationships and dependencies without manually parsing rule files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a natural language query THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant Drools rules and their relationships
2. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show rule dependencies and connections in a graph format
3. WHEN multiple rules are related THEN the system SHALL highlight the relationship types (imports, extends, calls, etc.)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically parse Drools rule files, so that I can maintain an up-to-date knowledge graph without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Drools rule files (.drl) are present in the project THEN the system SHALL automatically parse and extract rule definitions
2. WHEN rule files are modified THEN the system SHALL update the knowledge graph accordingly
3. WHEN parsing fails THEN the system SHALL log specific error messages and continue processing other files
4. WHEN rules reference external facts or functions THEN the system SHALL identify and catalog these dependencies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a knowledge worker, I want to visualize rule relationships in a graph format, so that I can understand complex business logic flows and identify potential conflicts or gaps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the knowledge graph THEN the system SHALL display nodes representing rules, facts, and functions
2. WHEN nodes are connected THEN the system SHALL show labeled edges indicating relationship types
3. WHEN a user clicks on a node THEN the system SHALL display detailed rule information and source code
4. WHEN the graph is large THEN the system SHALL provide filtering and search capabilities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the RAG system to provide contextual answers about rules, so that I can get comprehensive explanations that include related rules and business context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN answering queries THEN the system SHALL provide context from related rules and dependencies
2. WHEN explaining a rule THEN the system SHALL include information about when it fires and what it affects
3. WHEN multiple rules conflict THEN the system SHALL identify and explain the conflicts
4. WHEN rules have priorities or salience THEN the system SHALL explain the execution order

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the system to identify rule patterns and anomalies, so that I can maintain code quality and identify potential issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing rules THEN the system SHALL identify common patterns and anti-patterns
2. WHEN rules are unused or unreachable THEN the system SHALL flag them for review
3. WHEN circular dependencies exist THEN the system SHALL detect and report them
4. WHEN rule complexity exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL suggest simplification opportunities
